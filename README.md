# Markdown Notebook
I couldn't find a suitable simple Markdown Notebook, so I "created an own" 

## Usage

1. git init .
2. git remote add blabla... # (E.g. bitbucket private repo)
3. Do
   ```bash
   ./edit.sh
   ```
4. Write
5. Save
6. Exit (The journal will be committed and pushed to the origin at this point)
7. Done!
